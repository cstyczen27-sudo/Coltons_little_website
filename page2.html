        <h1>Welcome to Coltons Little Website</h1>

        <p1>This is page 2 of my little website that I am currently learning to build. While it may look small<br> 
            one day this website will look like a proper website. I care very much about how my website<br> 
            looks. I want it to look the best that it can when it is finished and for it to be something that I can<br> 
            use in my resume one day to show potential employers how well I can write code. While that<br> 
            might be a long way, I think that this class will be able to teach me and build the skills required<br> 
            to turn this website into what I envision it to be.<br>
        </p1>
        <br><br>
        <p2>So far while programming this website I have found myself coding in HTML which is<br> 
            something that I have already gained some experience in in previous courses at Adrian College<br> 
            however it has been a while since I last used it so this class is helping me brush up on it however something new that I have started to use is Visual studio code which I really want<br> 
            to learn how to use quickly due to the fact that it has made my life while coding a lot <br> 
            simpler so it has been a very effective tool 
        </p2>
